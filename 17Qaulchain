🚀 Quantime (QTM) Token Deployment Guide
This guide will walk you through deploying your Quantime ERC-20 smart contract to the Sepolia Ethereum testnet using Remix and MetaMask.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following set up:

MetaMask Wallet: Install the MetaMask browser extension and create a wallet.

Sepolia Test ETH: You'll need some Sepolia ETH to pay for the deployment (gas fees). You can get this for free from a "faucet":

sepoliafaucet.com

infura.io/faucet/sepolia

## Step 1: Set Up the Contract in Remix
Remix is a web-based IDE for writing and deploying smart contracts.

Open Remix: Go to remix.ethereum.org.

Create a New File: In the File Explorer tab, create a new file named Quantime.sol.

Paste the Code: Copy and paste your complete Quantime contract code into this file. Remix will automatically import the OpenZeppelin contracts.

## Step 2: Compile the Smart Contract
Next, you need to compile the Solidity code into bytecode that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can understand.

Go to the Compiler Tab: On the left-hand sidebar, navigate to the Solidity Compiler tab.

Select the Compiler Version: Choose a compiler version that matches the one in your code (0.8.20 or higher).

Compile: Click the Compile Quantime.sol button.

If everything is correct, you'll see a green checkmark, indicating a successful compilation.

## Step 3: Deploy the Contract
Now it's time to deploy your contract to the Sepolia testnet.

Go to the Deploy Tab: Navigate to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.

Set the Environment:

In the ENVIRONMENT dropdown, select Injected Provider - MetaMask.

This will prompt your MetaMask wallet to connect to Remix. Approve the connection. Make sure your MetaMask is set to the Sepolia network.

Configure the Deployment:

Under the CONTRACT dropdown, make sure Quantime is selected.

Next to the Deploy button, there is an input field for the initialSupply. Enter the amount of QTM you want to create. For 1 billion tokens, enter 1000000000.

Deploy: Click the Deploy button.

Confirm in MetaMask: MetaMask will pop up with a transaction confirmation. Review the gas fee and click Confirm.

After a few moments, the transaction will be confirmed on the blockchain. You'll see your deployed contract appear under the "Deployed Contracts" section in Remix.

## Step 4: Interact with Your Deployed Token
You can now interact with your live QTM token contract directly from Remix.

Copy the Contract Address: Click the copy icon next to your deployed contract in Remix to get its address.

Add Token to MetaMask:

Open MetaMask, go to the Tokens tab, and click Import tokens.

Paste the contract address. The symbol (QTM) and decimals (18) should auto-fill.

Click Add custom token, and you will see your initial supply of 1,000,000,000 QTM in your wallet!

Use Contract Functions in Remix:

balanceOf: Enter your wallet address to check your QTM balance.

transfer: Send some QTM to another address.

mint: As the owner, you can mint new tokens for any address.

burn: Destroy some of your own tokens.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed and tested your Quantime (QTM) ERC-20 token on the Sepolia testnet.
